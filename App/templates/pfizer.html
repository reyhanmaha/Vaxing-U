            <h4>Pfizer Information :</h4>
            <br>
             <h4>The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine also contains a harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA). The COVID-19 mRNA teaches cells in the body how to create an immune response to the virus that causes COVID-19. This response helps protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future. After the body produces an immune response, it discards all of the vaccine ingredients, just as it would discard any substance that cells no longer need. This process is a part of normal body functioning.</h4> 
             <br>
             <h4>Number of Shots: 2 doses in the primary series, given 3 to 8 weeks apart.</h4>
             <br>
             <h4>People ages 5 years and older who are moderately or severely immunocompromised should get a third dose at least 4 weeks after their second dose.</h4>
             <br>
             <h4>Booster Shot: People ages 12 years and older who received a Pfizer-BioNTech primary series should get a booster. Some people can also choose to receive a second booster.</h4>
